Transient Solver for combustion with chemical reactions.

The chemistry model in reactingFoam is a Partially Stirred Reactor Combustion Model
or PaSR, which generally is used for turbulent non-premixed combustion. The PaSR
model is a modified version of the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) where the chemical
timescale is handled differently.

The model calculates a finite rate, based on both turbulence and chemistry time scales. 
Depending on mesh resolution, the Cmix parameter can be used to scale the turbulence 
mixing time scale. 

If turbulent combustion is enabled, reaction rates are based on which is the slowest, 
chemistry or mixing. The mixing or turbulent reaction rate is defined as the turbulent 
dissipation rate Îµ divided by the turbulent kinetic energy k.

reactingFoam proves to approach a steady solution. It is interesting to see that the 
transient model becomes steady and this also means that modelling this case transient 
is somewhat an unnecessary waste of computational resources.

To get a steady solution using reactingFoam at least 10 seconds has to be simulated.
The 10 seconds of real time corresponds to a very large computational time ~ 1week
(as from Aalborg univ paper, will check myself soon).

Theory
######################################
The Eddy-Dissipation Concept (EDC) assumes reactions in fine structures.
EDC reaction rate depends on turbulent flow properties and chemical kinetics 
approach for fine structure composition.

Varoius Chemical kinetics approaches for fine structure composition:

1. Fast Chemistry (least accurate, fastest)
-assumes infinitely fast reactions
-Assumes sufficient time to achieve equilibrium inside fine structures
-Works only with irreversible global reactions
-Combustion occurs if fuel, oxidizer and products meet simultaneously

2. Local Extinction(more accurate, not that fast)
-employs data from a priori PSR calculations.

3. Perfectly Stirred Reactor(most accurate, slowest)
-determines the steady-state of a perfectly stirred reactor
-The PaSR combustion model derives the reation rate in a transient manner.
