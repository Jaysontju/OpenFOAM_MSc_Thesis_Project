$ sed 's/find/replace/' file

.(dot) tries to match a single character. 
The ^ tries to match a pattern(any character) in the beginning of the line.
The $ tries to match a pattern in the end of the line.

To remove 1st character in every line:
sed 's/^.//' file

To remove last character of every line:
sed 's/.$//' file

To remove first character only if it is a specific character:
sed 's/^F//' file

To remove last character only if it is a specific character:
sed 's/x$//' file

To remove 1st 4 characters of every line
sed -r 's/.{4}//' file
sed -r 's/.{3}$//' file (last 4 characters)

To remove everything except the 1st 3 characters in every line:
sed -r 's/(.{3}).*/\1/' file
sed -r 's/.*(.{3})/\1/' file (last 3 characters)
.* matches any number of characters, and the first 3 characters matched are grouped using parantheses. In the replacement, by having \1 only the group is retained, leaving out the remaining part. 

To delete everything in a line followed by a character:
sed 's/a.*//' file
