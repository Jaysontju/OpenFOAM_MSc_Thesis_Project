#on choosing the appropriate fvSolution parameters

fvSolution contains a set of subdictionaries that are specific to the solver being run.
A small set of standard subdictionaries that cover most of those used by the standard solvers. 
These subdictionaries include 
solvers, 
relaxationFactors, 
PISO and SIMPLE.

        The solver stops if either of the following conditions are reached:
        1. The residual falls below the solver tolerance, tolerance(compulsory);
        2. Tthe ratio of current to initial residuals falls below the solver relative tolerance, relTol(compulsory);
        3. The number of iterations exceeds a maximum number of iterations, maxIter(optional);
        
        #In transient simulations, it is usual to set the solver relative tolerance to 0 to force the solution to 
        #converge to the solver tolerance in each time step.
