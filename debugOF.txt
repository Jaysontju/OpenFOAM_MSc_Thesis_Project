Whenever you are making your own solvers with custom sub-models, the debug version can help greatly as the stack track will give you the line numbers where the crash occurs (99% of the time anyway).

To set this up, you need to change the WM_COMPILE_OPTION from "Opt" to "Debug", source your bashrc file and then recompile the entire OpenFOAM installation, including your solver and models.
