# OpenFOAM_MSc_Thesis_Project

The aim of the project was to develop a multi-physics model for simulating non-premixed
turbulent combustion of gaseous fuels in an industrial furnace. The multi-physics model
was developed using OpenFOAM which is a C++ toolbox for the development of customized 
numerical solvers, and pre-/post-processing utilities for the solution of problems arising
in the field of continuum mechanics. In this project, a new solver was implemented in 
OpenFOAM for turbulent combustion and radiation modelling. 

This work was done as a part of obtaining a Masterâ€™s degree in the Applied Mathematics
department at the faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science
at the Delft University of Technology.
