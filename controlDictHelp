startFrom controls the start time of the simulation.
- firstTime Earliest time step from the set of time directories.
- startTime Time specified by the startTime keyword entry.
- latestTime Most recent time step from the set of time directories.  

startFrom       startTime; 

startTime       0;

stopAt controls the end time of the simulation.
- endTime Time specified by the endTime keyword entry.
- writeNow Stops simulation on completion of current time step and writes data.
- noWriteNow Stops simulation on completion of current time step and does not write out data.
- nextWrite Stops simulation on completion of next scheduled write time, specified by writeControl.

#deltaT should be set to 1 since in steady state cases such as this is effectively an iteration counter.

writeControl controls the timing of write output to file.
- timeStep† Writes data every writeInterval time steps.
- runTime Writes data every writeInterval seconds of simulated time.
- adjustableRunTime Writes data every writeInterval seconds of simulated time, adjusting the time steps to coincide with the writeInterval if necessary — used in cases with automatic time step adjustment.
- cpuTime Writes data every writeInterval seconds of CPU time.
- clockTime Writes data out every writeInterval seconds of real time.
